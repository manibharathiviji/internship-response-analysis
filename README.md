## 📂 Dataset & Methodology  
**Confidentiality Notice:** This dataset contains sensitive student data and **cannot be shared** publicly. However, data cleaning techniques and a synthetic sample dataset structure are provided below.  

### 📄 Synthetic Dataset  
To help understand the dataset structure without exposing confidential data, a **synthetic dataset** with anonymized values is provided.  
📩 **[Download Synthetic Dataset](https://github.com/manibharathiviji/internship-response-analysis/blob/main/synthetic_dataset.csv)**


The synthetic dataset contains the following columns:  
- **Timestamp**: Submission time of the response  
- **STREAM**: Student's academic stream (Arts, Science, Commerce)  
- **DEPARTMENT**: Department name  
- **DESIRED FIELD**: Preferred career field  
- **MINIMUM HOURS OF WORK**: Expected internship work hours  
- **COMPLETION REWARD**: Preferred reward (Certificate, Stipend, Both)  

You can use this dataset to explore data structure and apply statistical techniques like the Chi-Square Test.  
**Confidentiality Notice:** This dataset contains sensitive student data and **cannot be shared** publicly. However, data cleaning techniques and a synthetic sample dataset structure are provided below.  
- **Survey Data:** Collected from 424 students across 32 departments (Arts, Science, Commerce).  
- **Data Collection:** Conducted via **Google Forms** on **October 29, 2022**.  
- **Statistical Method:** **Chi-Square Test of Independence** used to analyze relationships between variables.  
- **Hypothesis:**  
  - **H₀ (Null Hypothesis):** No relationship between students' streams and their choice of completion reward.  
  - **H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):** There is a relationship between students' streams and their choice of completion reward.

## 📊 Key Findings  
✅ **Observed Chi-Square Value:** **6.51**  
✅ **Tabulated Chi-Square Value (α = 0.05, df = 4):** **9.48**  
✅ **Conclusion:** Since **X² (calculated) < X² (tabulated)**, we **reject the null hypothesis**, confirming a **relationship exists** between students' streams and their choice of completion reward.
